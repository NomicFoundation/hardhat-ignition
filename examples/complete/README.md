# Complete Example for Ignition

This is a bit of a contrived example project, intended mostly to ensure working end-to-end functionality across the API.

## Deploying

To run the ignition deploy against the ephemeral hardhat network:

```shell
npx hardhat deploy CompleteModule.js
```

## Test

To run the hardhat tests using ignition:

```shell
npm run test
```
