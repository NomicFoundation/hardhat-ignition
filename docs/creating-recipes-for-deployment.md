# Creating Recipes for Deployments

An **Ingition** deployment is composed of recipes. A recipe is a special javascript/typescript function that encapsulates several on-chain transactions (e.g. deploy a contract, invoke a contract function etc).

For example, this is a minimal recipe `MyRecipe` that deploys an instance of a `Token` contract and exposes it to any consumer of `MyRecipe`:

```javascript
// ./ignition/MyRecipe.ts
import { buildRecipe, RecipeBuilder } from "@ignored/hardhat-ignition";

export default buildRecipe("MyRecipe", (m: RecipeBuilder) => {
  const token = m.contract("Token");

  return { token };
});
```

Recipes can be deployed directly at the cli (with `npx hardhat deploy ./ignition/MyRecipe.ts`), within Hardhat mocha tests (see [Ignition in Tests](TBD)) or consumed by other Recipes to allow for complex deployments.

During a deployment **Ignition** uses the recipe to generate an execution plan of the transactions to run and the order and dependency in which to run them. A recipe uses the passed `RecipeBuilder` to specify the on-chain transactions that will _eventually_ be run, and how they relate to each other to allow building a dependency graph.

## Deploying a contract

Ignition is aware of the contracts within the `./contracts` **Hardhat** folder. Ignition can deploy any compilable local contract by name:

```tsx
const token = m.contract("Token");
```

`token` here is called a **contract future**. It represents the contract that will _eventually_ be deployed.

### Constructor arguments

In **Solidity** contracts may have constructor arguments that need satisfied on deployment. This can be done by passing an `args` array as part of the options:

```tsx
const token = m.contract("Token", {
  args: ["My Token", "TKN", 18],
});
```

### Dependencies between contracts

If a contract needs the address of another contract as a constructor argument, the contract future can be used:

```tsx
const a = m.contract("A");
const b = m.contract("B", {
  args: [a],
});
```

You can think of this as `b` being analogue to a promise of an address, although futures are not promises.

### Executing a method in a contract

```tsx
const token = m.contract("Token");
const exchange = m.contract("Exchange");

m.call(exchange, "addToken", {
  args: [token],
});
```

### Using an existing contract

A user might need to execute a method in a contract that wasn't deployed by Ignition. An existing contract can be leveraged by passing an address and abi:

```tsx
const abi = [{...}]
const uniswap = m.contractAt("UniswapRouter", "0x123...", abi)

m.call(uniswap, "swap", { ... })
```

### Deploying from an artifact

To allow you to use your own mechanism for getting the contract artifact, `contract` supports passing an `Artifact` as an optional second parameter:

```javascript
const artifact = await this.hre.artifacts.readArtifact("Foo");

const userRecipe = buildRecipe("MyRecipe", (m) => {
  m.contract("Foo", artifact, {
    args: [0],
  });
});
```

### Linking libraries

A library can be deployed and linked to a contract by passing the libraries contract future as a named entry under the libraries option:

```tsx
const safeMath = m.library("SafeMath");
const contract = m.contract("Contract", {
  libraries: {
    SafeMath: safeMath,
  },
});
```

A library is deployed in the same way as a contract.

### Using the network chain id

The recipe builder (`m`) exposes the chain id of the network in which the contracts are being deployed. This is useful if you need to do different things depending on the network.

```tsx
const userRecipe = buildRecipe("MyRecipe", (m) => {
  const daiAddresses = {
    1: "0x123...", // mainnet DAI
    4: "0x234...", // rinkeby DAI
  };

  const daiAddress = daiAddresses[m.chainId];
  const myContract = m.contract("MyContract", {
    args: [daiAddress],
  });
});
```

### Recipe Parameters

Recipes can have parameters that are accessed using the RecipeBuilder object:

```tsx
const symbol = m.getParam("tokenSymbol");
const name = m.getParam("tokenName");
const token = m.contract("Token", {
  args: [symbol, name, 1_000_000],
});
```

When a recipe is deployed, the proper parameters must be provided. If they are not available, the deployment won't be executed. You can use optional params with default values too:

```tsx
const symbol = m.getOptionalParam("tokenSymbol", "TKN");
```

## Modules

Similarly to creating and using Recipes with `buildRecipe(...)` and `m.useRecipe(...)`, you may also choose to create and use Modules using `buildModule(...)` and `m.useModule(...)`:

```tsx
// ./ignition/MyRecipe.ts
import {
  buildRecipe,
  buildModule,
  RecipeBuilder,
} from "@ignored/hardhat-ignition";

const myModule = buildModule("MyModule", (m: RecipeBuilder) => {
  const symbol = m.getParam("tokenSymbol");
  const name = m.getParam("tokenName");
  const token = m.contract("Token", {
    args: [symbol, name, 1_000_000],
  });

  return { token };
});

export default buildRecipe("MyRecipe", (m: RecipeBuilder) => {
  const { token } = m.useModule(myModule, {
    parameters: {
      tokenName: "EXAMPLE",
      tokenSymbol: "XMPL",
    },
  });

  return { token };
});
```

The difference in using a Module instead of a Recipe is that, no matter how many times you invoke a given module via `m.useModule(...)`, that module will only be executed one time, with the results cached internally and returned for subsequent invocations.

To enforce this, there are two rules that must be followed when creating modules:

- Parameters passed into subsequent calls of `m.useModule(...)` must match the parameters used for the first invocation of a given module
- Only `CallableFuture` types can be returned when building a module (i.e. contracts or libraries)
