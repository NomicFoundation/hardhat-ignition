## 0.13.0 - 2023-12-13

### Added

- Add support for setting the default sender account from tests and scripts ([#639](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-ignition/issues/639))

- Split out `ethers` support from `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-plugin`, to allow opting for either **ethers** or **Viem** in tests and scripts. If you were using `hre.ignition.deploy(...)` in tests or scripts you will need to install, and require in your Hardhat config, the `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-plugin-ethers` package.
